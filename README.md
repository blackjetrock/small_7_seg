This construction is similar to larger displays that can be bought, it's just a bit smaller and more dense in terms of the number of digits. The PCB is about 60mm wide and 14mm high. The PCB was hand assembled and then soldered in a reflow oven, but it should be possible to get it assembled by a PCB manufacturer. The LEDs are red. There's no filter. The display looks a lot better in real life than in the photos, it's very difficult to photograph this display. The diffuser is a piec eof masking tape stuck over the display at the monet, this also holds the frame on to the PCB, That coud be tidied up.
